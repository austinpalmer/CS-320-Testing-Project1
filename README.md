I can esnure that my software is functional and secure through the use of testing techniques such as unit testing, functional testing, and acceptance testing.

I break down the user's needs into several smaller buisness and functional requirements which I can then build a progma based on.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first analyzing requirements and creating a document to record these requirements. Next I start by building classes and methods based
on the requirement I am trying to match.
